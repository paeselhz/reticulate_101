# Reticulate

--

  ## {reticulate} is a tool developed by RStudio to allow the integration between scripts created in both R and Python.
  
--

  ## It is built up by a set of tools that allow the execution of Python code inside of R environments, as well as the transit between objects created within R and objects created within Python. Apart from that, it allows the integration of R environments with Python-specific environments via `virtualenv`, conda, and others.
